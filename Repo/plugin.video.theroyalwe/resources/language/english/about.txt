Enjoy The Royal We, revisited!

The Royal We is getting better then ever. It's all about simplicity and lots of sources. No settings. No configuration (except for a Trakt.tv account if you have one).
There is a common scraper routine that dynamically loads a list of site scrapers. These can be enabled or disabled through the context menu or the settings in the event one of them breaks or is running slowly.
Some sites require a username and password. These are disabled by default. You can enter credentials through the settings and enable them if you want.

Enjoy!
